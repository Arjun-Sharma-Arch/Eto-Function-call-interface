# Eto-Function-call-interface
This project attempts to make a user interface using Eto in Rhino 6 WIP. 
The UI collects geometrical data from Rhino and then is supposed to display information regarding the surface. 
The problem is that every time the UI tries to run a external function using a button, rhino crashes.
